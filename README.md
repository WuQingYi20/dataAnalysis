# VR Immersion Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of factors influencing total immersion in virtual reality (VR) experiences. The study aims to investigate the relationships between various factors, such as textures, time, locomotion, width, and height, and their impact on total immersion.

## Getting Started

To explore the analysis, please open and read the Jupyter notebook `vrImmersion.ipynb`. This notebook contains the data preprocessing, multiple linear regression analysis, interpretation of results, and conclusions.

## Methodology

The analysis is conducted using Python and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

The multiple linear regression model is used to investigate the relationships between the dependent variable 'totalImmersion' and the independent variables 'textures', 'time', 'locomotion', 'width', and 'height'. The results are then interpreted, and the findings are connected to the original research question and hypothesis.

## Conclusions

The analysis provides insights into the significant predictors of total immersion in VR experiences. For a detailed interpretation of the results and overall conclusion, please refer to the `vrImmersion.ipynb` notebook.
